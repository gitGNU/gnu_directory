## Importing data

Loading data from package files:

    $ pv .../Packages python | python load_packages.py

Packages files can be obtained from Debian mirrors, and are cached by APT in
/var/lib/apt/lists.

Loading package descriptions:

    $ pv .../Translation-en | python load_descriptions.py

Loading data from copyright files:

    $ python load_copyright.py main/*/*/current/copyright | tee cp_import.log

Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to easily and quickly get copyright files
for all packages in main if you are not a Debian developer. I obtained them by
logging into powell.debian.org (which hosts.packages.debian.org) and running:

    $ cd /srv/packages.debian.org/www/changelogs/pool
    $ tar -zchf ~/copyright.tar.gz main/*/*/current/copyright
